# ChainReactionTheGame
This is the game Chain Reaction, I have tried to program in python3 with OpenGL for graphics. I programmed this game because I intend to add additional features to the game like:


    (1) a triangular grid instead a square one.

    (2) variable grid sizes.

    (3) make a 3d version of the game.

    (4) make a 3d cube/cuboid version of the game.

There are two versions right now:
(1) ChainReaction_console_edition.py: This is the first Draft of the game I had made. This is meant to be played on only the console/cammand prompt. In this version there are no graphics.
(2) ChainReaction_opengl.py: This edition contains Graphics.

For the OpenGL version the controls programmed right now:
(1) Arrow Keys: to move the active cube.
(2) Mouse scroll wheel: Used to move towards or away from the center of the grid.
(3) Mouse left click and drag: Used to rotate(only in x & y directions) the grid about its center.
(4) Mouse middle click and drag: Used to rotate(in z axis) the grid about its center.
(5) Mouse right click and drag: Used to pan the camera(in x & y axis)
