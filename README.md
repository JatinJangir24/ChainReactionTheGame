# ChainReactionTheGame
This is the game Chain Reaction, I have tried to program in python3 with OpenGL for graphics. I programmed this game because I intend to add additional features to the game like:
(1) a triangular grid instead a square one.
(2) variable grid sizes.
(3) make a 3d version of the game.
(4) make a 3d cube/cuboid version of the game.

There are two versions right now:
(1) ChainReaction_console_edition.py: This is the first Draft of the game I had made. This is meant to be played on only the console/cammand prompt. In this version there are no graphics.
(2) ChainReaction_opengl.py: This edition contains Graphics.
